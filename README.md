<h1 align="center">🐧 Unix-SIT — *nix Install Guides</h1>

<p align="center">
  <strong>A modular, dynamically generated, security-focused *nix-like installation system.</strong>
</p>

<p align="center">
  <em><strong>S.I.T</strong> is <strong>Smart Installation Tool</strong>, so the name reads
  either "Unix SIT" or, in full, "Unix Smart Installation Tool".<br>
  <em>*nix Install Guides</em> is what the site calls itself; <em>Unix-SIT</em> is
  the project and the repository.</em>
</p>

<p align="center">
  <em>Today: Arch Linux. Gentoo, FreeBSD and OpenBSD are in progress — the name
  changed ahead of the support so links would only break once.<br>
  Nothing below claims an OS that is not implemented yet.</em>
</p>

<p align="center">
  <strong>Most guides here are untested on real hardware.</strong> If something
  is wrong, <a href="https://github.com/tilas01/Unix-SIT/issues">open an issue</a> —
  feedback is genuinely wanted and is the fastest way this gets better.

## 🚦 Four ways to use this — pick one

No wrong answer. All four end at the same system with the same options; they
differ only in how much is automated versus how much you read. **The website is
the recommended way** — the two repo-only routes exist for when you cannot run
it.

| | Route | Best for | Start here |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1** | ***nix Install Generator** — one form, get a script | You know what you want, and you are on a PC | **[Open the generator →](https://tilas01.github.io/Unix-SIT/)** |
| **2** | ***nix Install Walkthrough** — one question at a time, each explained | You are on mobile, or not yet sure what you want | **[Open the walkthrough →](https://tilas01.github.io/Unix-SIT/manual.html)** |
| **3** | **Website wiki** — the same options, explained, done by hand, with hyperlinks | You want to understand each step and follow along in a browser | **[Open the wiki →](https://tilas01.github.io/Unix-SIT/wiki.html#manual-install)** |
| **4** | **This repo only** — plain markdown and README links, no website | Your machine is too slow for the site, has no JavaScript, or you prefer reading on GitHub | [Start at 01-pre-installation](docs/01-pre-installation.md) |

Routes 1 and 2 cover the same install and produce the same kind of output — a
bash script and a matching markdown guide. Route 3 is the same material as a
navigable wiki; route 4 is the same material as flat markdown that reads well on
GitHub and needs nothing but a browser that renders text.

> **Config files are not yet interchangeable between routes 1 and 2.** Both wrap
> their answers in the same JSON envelope, but the answers inside are shaped
> differently — the generator stores them per form control, the walkthrough
> stores them per question — so a config exported from one does not currently
> configure the other. A translation layer is the next planned change. Until it
> lands, export and re-import within the same tool.
Every option in the generator right-clicks to its wiki explanation, which is how
routes 1–2 stay tied to routes 3–4.

> **Route 4 is the fallback, not the recommendation.** It works — every option
> is documented and cross-linked — but it is more work than letting the site
> assemble the guide for you. Reach for it only if you cannot run the website.
> The generator and walkthrough do nothing you could not do by hand from the
> [Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide), which
> remains the authority for all of it.

## 🔧 Hardware security — read before buying anything

The generator runs **after** your firmware. If someone can modify the firmware,
none of it helps: they can capture your passphrase before the kernel exists.

**[Hardware & Firmware Security →](https://tilas01.github.io/Unix-SIT/wiki.html#hardware-security)**
covers, in order of value for money:

1. **Locking down the firmware you already have** — free, reversible, do this first.
2. **[BusKill](https://www.buskill.in/)** — a magnetic USB cable that triggers a lock or shutdown when separated from you. Cheap, needs no firmware changes, and covers the case FDE does not: the machine being taken while already unlocked.
3. **Measured boot** — coreboot + [Heads](https://osresearch.net/) + a TPM + a USB token, which can prove the firmware is unchanged *before* you type your passphrase. This is what a [NitroPad](https://www.nitrokey.com/products/nitropads) demonstrates.

coreboot and libreboot are both written up there, with the trade-off stated
plainly: coreboot + Heads gets you tamper-evident boot; libreboot gets you zero
proprietary blobs but generally on hardware too old to have a usable TPM. You
usually cannot maximise both. The ThinkPad flashing procedure is deliberately
out of scope — getting it wrong bricks the machine and it is board-specific.

## 🛡️ Security tools

Native Rust tools built for this project. All standalone, all open source.

| | Tool | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| <img src="img/icons/libre-otp-64.png" width="40" alt=""> | **[Libre OTP](security-tools/libre-otp/)** | TOTP/HOTP two-factor for boot, login and SSH. Defaults to a *silent* mode: one secret, never displayed, compared internally at boot so a mismatch means the boot chain changed. |
| <img src="img/icons/anti-ducky-64.png" width="40" alt=""> | **[Anti-Ducky](security-tools/anti-ducky/)** | Watches USB HID keystroke timing and sandboxes unknown input devices, blocking BadUSB / Rubber Ducky injection before the payload can type. |
| <img src="img/icons/anti-evil-maid-64.png" width="40" alt=""> | **[Anti-Evil Maid](security-tools/anti-evil-maid/)** | Verifies boot integrity and hides the real encrypted target behind decoy kernel entries. Also suspends the LUKS volume on idle or on session lock, so the master key leaves RAM — which a screen lock does not do. |
| <img src="img/icons/kernel-watcher-64.png" width="40" alt=""> | **[Kernel Watcher](security-tools/kernel-watcher/)** | Async filesystem monitor that flags infostealers touching browser profiles, SSH keys and wallets, and detects userland rootkit behaviour. |
| <img src="img/icons/scarecrow-64.png" width="40" alt=""> | **[Scarecrow](security-tools/scarecrow/)** | Plants canary tokens and spoofs sandbox artefacts so malware that checks whether it is being analysed stays dormant. Also provides three optional duress PINs for the **login** prompt — duress, decoy, or both at once. |
| <img src="img/icons/aur-guard-64.png" width="40" alt=""> | **[AUR Guard](security-tools/aur-guard/)** | Reads a `PKGBUILD` and its `.install` files before `makepkg` runs any of them, and reports what is worth reading yourself. Read-only, never needs root. It will never tell you a package is safe. |
| <img src="img/icons/unix-security-suite-64.png" width="40" alt=""> | **[Unix Security Suite](security-tools/unix-security-suite/)** | The five daemons above in one signed binary, dispatching to whichever you ask for. AUR Guard stays standalone — it never needs root, and bundling it with tools that do would misrepresent what running it costs. |

Every icon, favicon and banner in this repository is generated from one source —
[`scripts/gen-icons.py`](scripts/gen-icons.py) — which emits SVG, PNG, ICO and
the raw RGBA blob each GUI binary embeds for its window icon. Regenerate with
`python scripts/gen-icons.py`; the output is deterministic.

### Install all of them in one step

```bash
curl -fsSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tilas01/Unix-SIT/main/scripts/install-security-suite.sh

# Read it before running it as root
less install-security-suite.sh

sudo bash install-security-suite.sh --all
```

[`install-security-suite.sh`](scripts/install-security-suite.sh) downloads each
binary, verifies its SHA-512 hash **and** GPG signature, installs it, and writes
hardened systemd units.

It **fails closed** — anything that does not verify aborts the whole run, and
there is no `--skip-verify` flag. Everything is verified before anything is
installed, so a failure part-way cannot leave you with half a suite. Daemons are
installed but left **stopped**: Anti-Ducky can reject a keyboard and OTP can
block login, so enabling them is a decision you make after reading the config.

```bash
--all / --only libre-otp,scarecrow   # everything, or a subset
--dry-run                            # show what would happen, change nothing
--from-source                        # build with cargo from this repo
--enable                             # also start the daemons now
--uninstall                          # remove binaries and units
```

## 🔒 Verifying downloads

Release binaries are SHA-512 hashed and, when the CI signing key is configured,
GPG-signed. The public key (`tilas01.asc`) is committed at the repository root.

**Current signing key — trust this one:**

```
5CC1 B2BE D4D0 5F65 E9E9  6542 3AA7 4BEC 12F3 D5ED
tilas01
ed25519, created 2026-07-26, expires 2028-07-25
```

The user ID is the bare name `tilas01` — no email address, by design. An email
in a key's user ID is published forever in every copy of it and cannot be taken
back.

```bash
gpg --import tilas01.asc                                  # 1. import the key
gpg --fingerprint 5CC1B2BED4D05F65E9E965423AA74BEC12F3D5ED  # 2. compare against the block above
gpg --verify libre-otp.sig libre-otp                      # 3. verify the signature
sha512sum -c libre-otp.sha512                             # 4. verify the hash
```

A `Good signature from "tilas01"` plus an
`OK` means the binary is what was built. If either check fails, do not run it.

You can also use [`scripts/verify-integrity.sh`](scripts/verify-integrity.sh),
which does all three steps and refuses to pass if `gpg` is unavailable.

### 🔑 Signing key history

The signing key has been rotated a few times. The full history is below so that
anyone verifying an older release can tell which key was current when, and why
each one was retired. **Only the current key at the top of this section should
be trusted.**

| Key fingerprint | Period | Retired because |
|---|---|---|
| `5CC1 B2BE D4D0 5F65 E9E9  6542 3AA7 4BEC 12F3 D5ED` | 2026-07-26 → current | — (current) |
| `69D7 7707 109F 4152 646A  B850 669F 4E9A 22A8 A316` | 2026-07-26 | Data loss — private key no longer available |
| `745F 82B4 1AFD 9456 3685  9C92 2F43 352E C307 EF09` | 2026-07-25 | Withdrawn before use — never signed a release |
| `4C03 83A1 68D0 EA1D D6F1  ACB5 A131 18E0 3A7D 55A0` | 2026-06-18 → 2026-07-25 | **Compromised** — private key was committed to public git history. **Revoked.** |

Only one of these keys was ever *compromised*: `4C0383A1…`, whose private key
material (`.keys/private.key`, `.keys/private-keys-v1.d/*.key`) was committed to
this public repository and is still recoverable from git history. It is
**revoked**, and the revocation is published as
[`tilas01-revoked-2026-06.asc`](tilas01-revoked-2026-06.asc). The later
retirements were housekeeping — a withdrawn key that never shipped, and a key
whose private half was subsequently lost — not breaches, so those keys carry no
revocation.

If you ever imported the compromised key, import its revocation so GnuPG stops
trusting it:

```bash
gpg --import tilas01-revoked-2026-06.asc
gpg --list-keys 4C0383A168D0EA1DD6F1ACB5A13118E03A7D55A0   # must show "revoked"
```

**Treat every signature made by `4C0383A1…` as meaningless.** Re-verify anything
you installed from a release signed with it against the current key, or rebuild
from source using [`docs/building-from-source.md`](docs/building-from-source.md)
— the builds are reproducible, so a rebuild is an independent check that does
not rely on any key at all.

Private key material for the current key is stored **outside this repository and
outside any cloud-synced folder**, and `.keys/`, `*.key` and `*.gpg` are in
[`.gitignore`](.gitignore). Nothing secret is committed.

## 🗺️ Roadmap

Planned, not yet built:

* **Wider setup choice** — pick your exact window manager, or Xorg, or Wayland, or neither; shell (zsh and friends), colour palette, monospace font, size and syntax highlighting.
* **AUR review tool** — the AUR is a recurring attack surface. The idea: review each `PKGBUILD`/`makepkg` before it runs, show the reasoning so you can review it too, record every file the install touches so it can be reverted precisely, remember authors whose packages have consistently been clean, block or warn on critical paths, and cross-check against a public list of known-malicious AUR packages. Killing a build mid-flight and rolling back is the core requirement.
* **Expanded hardware guidance** — more measured-boot walkthroughs for specific machines.

Contributions and issue reports are welcome.

## 🙏 Credits

* **[tilas01](https://github.com/tilas01)** — author, developer and maintainer of all project code, scripts, tooling and documentation.
* **[arch-guides-all](https://github.com/tilas01/arch-guides-all)** — where this
  started. A plain list of markdown guides with none of the machinery here: no
  generator, no walkthrough, no Rust tools. It is also, quietly, the most
  popular thing I have put on GitHub — eight stars, every one of which I can
  account for personally, and which I remain unreasonably pleased about. It is
  now deprecated in favour of this project, but the guides here are descended
  from it and it earned the retirement.
* **[dusklinux](https://github.com/dusklinux/dusky)** — creator of Dusky, the basis for the Dusky desktop option and its cheatsheet.
* **[Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/)** — the authoritative reference every procedure here follows.
* **[max-baz/arch-secure-boot](https://github.com/max-baz/arch-secure-boot)** — the Secure Boot / UKI approach, whose guide covers running LUKS with a Unified Kernel Image instead of GRUB, as used here. [`scripts/arch-secure-boot.sh`](scripts/arch-secure-boot.sh) is adapted from it.
* **[Snapper](https://github.com/openSUSE/snapper)** and **[usbkill](https://github.com/hephaest0s/usbkill)** — integrated into the generator.
* **[Claude](https://claude.com/claude-code)** (Anthropic) — the AI assistant that
  wrote and rebuilt much of this site, the generator, the manual walkthrough, the
  wiki and the Rust security tools, working alongside tilas01. Named rather than
  credited vaguely: you should know what wrote the code that partitions your
  disk. Every output is reviewed, tested and curated by tilas01, and nothing
  ships unreviewed — but "AI-assisted" is doing real work in that sentence, and
  the disclaimer at the top of every page means it.

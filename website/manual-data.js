   manual-data.js — the question set behind the manual walkthrough.
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Declarative on purpose. Every question is data: what it asks, when it applies,
   what each answer means, which wiki section explains it, and what it
   contributes to the generated guide. The renderer in manual.js knows nothing
   about Arch; it only knows how to draw a question and collect an answer.

   That split is what keeps this at parity with the dynamic generator. Adding an
   option means adding it here once, and it appears in the walkthrough, in the
   markdown guide, in the shell script and in the exported JSON together —
   rather than in three places that drift.

/* Values Dusky fixes for you. Selecting it locks these rather than silently

   value that matches no option leaves the question with no answer to carry
   forward. `tests/dusky-locks.mjs` fails the build if either stops holding. */
/* What choosing Dusky genuinely settles for you.

   Each of these is a thing Dusky's own install scripts require: Hyprland is a
   Wayland compositor, the dotfiles are written for zsh, and the status bar and
   menus are laid out around a Nerd Font's glyph widths. Pick something else and
   Dusky does not merely look different, it does not work.

   `palette` is deliberately NOT here. Tokyo Night is what this *site* uses, and
   forcing it onto somebody's installed desktop confused a house style with a
   requirement — Dusky themes itself and does not care which scheme you pick.

/* Where Dusky's automated setup can actually run, and why not, where it cannot.
   Dusky is Hyprland — a wlroots compositor on Wayland — installed by scripts
   that assume pacman and the AUR. That combination is what decides this, and
   the reasons differ enough per system to be worth stating rather than
   collapsing into "unsupported":

     Arch     its native target.
     Gentoo   Linux, so DRM/KMS, libinput and elogind are all present, and
              gui-wm/hyprland is packaged. The install steps need translating
              from pacman to emerge, which is work, not an obstacle.
     FreeBSD  Wayland and Hyprland both exist in ports, but nobody has verified
              Dusky's own scripts there. Offered untested would be worse than
              not offered — this project has removed that exact class of claim
              several times.
     OpenBSD  X11 and Xenocara. wlroots support is not there and Hyprland is not
              packaged, so this is not a gap that closes with effort.
     Pi OS    ships and expects its own desktop, and the Pi's graphics stack is
              not what Dusky's scripts assume. */

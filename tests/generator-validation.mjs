/* The generator must never refuse to generate over a question it has withdrawn.
 *
 * Choosing "All of them" for the wallpapers answers both the count and the
 * dark/light split, so validateConfigurations() greys both out. They stay on
 * screen, and the "No Selection Provided" option injected into every select at
 * load leaves them holding an empty value — so the required-field sweep, which
 * tested visibility alone, counted two options as still needing one. Generation
 * was refused, two dropdowns were outlined in red, and the walk-to-next control
 * marched the reader to controls that cannot be opened. There was no way out of
 * it from the page.
 *
 * Nothing caught it because nothing could. jsdom performs no layout, so
 * `offsetParent` is null for every element in it, the required-field filter
 * selects nothing, and the whole validation path is inert under every existing
 * gate — including the one that drives this same form. A shim answering
 * offsetParent from the computed display of each ancestor is what makes the
 * path executable here at all. It is an approximation of layout, and it is
 * enough, because the rule being tested is about state rather than about pixels.
 *
 * The invariant, stated once: a control the reader cannot act on cannot be
 * required. Asserted directly, so a future lock that disables a control without
 * giving it a value is caught here rather than by a reader.

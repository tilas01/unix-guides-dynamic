/* Every system that renames packages must rename the same set of them.
 *
 * `osPkgName()` returns the Arch name when a system's table has no entry for
 * it. That is the right default for a system whose names genuinely match
 * Arch's, and it is a silent defect for one whose names do not: a package
 * missing from the Raspberry Pi table does not throw and does not blank, it
 * arrives in the emitted command as the Arch spelling, so the reader is handed
 * `apt-get install networkmanager` and finds out at the terminal.
 *
 * Nothing else notices. The leakage gates count foreign *tools* — pacstrap,
 * emerge, pkg_add — and an Arch package name inside a correct apt command is
 * not one of those. Neither `bash -n` nor shellcheck has an opinion about
 * whether a package exists.
 *
 * So the tables are held to the same key set. Adding a name for one system and
 * forgetting the others is the failure this catches, and it is the failure that
 * happens, because the tables are long and are edited one system at a time.
 *
 * A second check runs the other way: an entry for a package no emitter can ever
 * ask about is dead weight that reads as coverage. Both directions matter,
 * because the whole point of the table is that its size means something.
